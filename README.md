# DISEMBER
### A simple tool with a user interface for quick and easy creation of beautiful DISCORD-EMBED  
A simple embed builder application. Having created an embed using a handy constructor, you can insert your bot's API key into the desired field and click "apply" under that field. After that in discord it is enough to write "_create" in the necessary channel!  

### Run like nw.js app
After downloading the project, drag the disember folder into nw.exe and wait for the magic :)
